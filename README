Description:
-----------

MPS-based numerical tools to diagonalize Hamiltonians of anyonic spin
chains.

modules/SU2k_MPS.py implements the class of anyonic matrix product
states (AMPS)

modules/functions.py contains the functions used in the itebd
algorithm.

In principle, general anyonic models can be handled. Here used and
tested only for SU2 level k anyonic models based on spin 1/2.

Written in python3.

Run:
----

python3 SU2k_iTEBD.py -p 4 -N 1000 -D 40 -t 0.01 -a 1 -b 1

See helper of SU2k_iTEBD for description of arguments.

To compute observables: 

EE_vs_D.py: computes the spectrum of transfer matrix, entanglement
entropy and energy

corr.py: computes correlation functions

GUI:
----

The program can be run also with a graphical user interface defined in gui.py.
It is written in PyQt5 (under GPL) and requires installation of this package.

Version and testing:
-------------------

Tested on Mac Os Sierra, Ubuntu 14.10, Windows 10

Version: beta
